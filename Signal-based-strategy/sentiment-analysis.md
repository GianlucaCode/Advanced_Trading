Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT) have significantly advanced the field of sentiment analysis by providing more nuanced and context-aware interpretations of text.

Their ability to capture long-range dependencies and understand context allows for a more accurate assessment of sentiment, reducing the likelihood of misclassification that is often seen in simpler models like Naive Bayes or Support Vector Machines.

The fine-tuning capabilities of these models enable domain-specific adaptations (like BloombergGPT or TimeGPT) which makes them useful for various applications in sentiment analysis.

In just a few lines of code, we can use the OpenAI GPT-4 model to predict the sentiment of a news headline.
