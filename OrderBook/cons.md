# **Reading JSON data:**

The read_json_from_file function in the InitialData class reads the entire JSON data into memory using json.load. If the JSON file is very large, it could consume a significant amount of memory. We might consider using a streaming JSON parser like ijson to process the JSON data in chunks, which would be more memory-efficient.

# **Order matching:**

In the match_orders function of the OrderBook class, there is a nested loop that iterates over both buy and sell orders. This may result in inefficient processing when handling large datasets, as the time complexity is O(n^2). We can optimize this matching algorithm by using a priority queue, which will allow us to process orders more efficiently.

# **Memory usage:**

When working with large datasets, it is essential to manage memory usage efficiently. In the script, buy and sell orders are stored in dictionaries and lists. For large datasets, we might consider using more memory-efficient data structures. For example, we can use Spark or Dask libraries to handle large data tables more efficiently.

# **Parallel processing:**

Script is currently single-threaded, which means it can only utilize one CPU core. For large datasets, we might consider parallelizing the processing, either by using multithreading or multiprocessing. This can help speed up the processing of large datasets by leveraging the full power of your CPU.
