# Description of repository structure

## Gre-Systems-Model

This folder contains resources and research papers related to the application of Grey System Theory (GST) in advanced trading and financial markets. Grey System Theory is an interdisciplinary research methodology that deals with problems characterized by insufficient information, incomplete data, and uncertain relationships between variables. The materials in this folder showcase how GST can be applied to predict and analyze various aspects of financial markets, such as cryptocurrency and gold price forecasting.

## Ideas_papaers

The Ideas_papers folder contains a curated collection of research papers focused on advanced trading strategies and financial engineering techniques. Topics covered include deep learning, prediction of stock returns, and volatility models, among others.

## ML-for-TA

This folder is dedicated to the implementation of a hybrid system that combines technical analysis and machine learning algorithms to predict stock market behavior. The Technical Analysis folder contains a collection of resources, including code examples and additional tools, to facilitate the implementation of this innovative approach. Additionally, this repository provides a comprehensive overview of the results obtained through the implementation of this hybrid system.

## OrderBook

The OrderBook folder contains a Python-based order book simulator and associated code, which allows users to practice and explore different order book strategies. This folder includes detailed documentation, tests, and an app for visualizing order book data.

## Resources

The Resources folder offers a comprehensive collection of links to resources like: books, scientific journals, websites, YouTube channels, and other resources focused on trading strategies and financial engineering. This folder is designed to serve as a one-stop-shop for industry professionals and enthusiasts seeking to broaden their knowledge and stay up-to-date with the latest trends and developments.
